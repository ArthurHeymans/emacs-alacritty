Notable missing functionality in detail:
1. Prompt Navigation - Very useful for navigating between shell prompts (C-c C-n / C-c C-p)
2. Compilation Mode Integration - Allows next-error to work in terminal buffers, jumping to errors
3. Bookmark Support - Save and restore terminal sessions with Emacs bookmarks
4. Bright Color Faces - emacs-alacritty only defines 8 basic faces; libvterm has 16 (with bright variants)
5. Copy Mode Refinements:
   - Fake newline handling (removing line-wrap artifacts)
   - Option to exclude prompt from copied text
   - yank-pop support
6. Font/Display Customization:
   - Toggle bold/underline/inverse-video rendering
   - Bold-as-bright-colors option
7. Smart Beginning of Line - Moves to after the prompt, not absolute beginning
8. Exit Functions Hook - Let users run code when terminal exits
Would you like me to help implement any of these missing features?
